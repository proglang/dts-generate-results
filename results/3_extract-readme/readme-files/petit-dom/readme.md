# petit-dom

A minimalist virtual DOM library. 

Diff algroithm is based on pre-optimizations described at
https://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/ and the algorithm presented
in the paper ["An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.6927&rep=rep1&type=pdf). There is also [an excellent article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/42279/Investigating-Myers-diff-algorithm-Part-of) which explains how the algorithm works. The article includes a GUI application to play
with the algorithm

## Trade offs

- üëé No Components. If you want a high level library with full Component support, check for libs like React, Preact or Inferno.
- üëé No separation between diffing and patching, you probably don't want that unless you're planning to build your own shceduling for DOM updates (currently all DOM updates are performed synchronously. At the time of this writing, probably React is the only lib that implements DOM updating over mulitple frames).
- üëé No Server Side Rendering (SSR) support, you can of course serve plain HTML from the server but currently the library doesn't support hydrating an existing DOM tree, you'll need to replace the whole tree with a new one (should be a fast operation in modern browsers but you'll have to measure for yourself).
- üëç [Reasonably fast diffing algorithm](https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html). **Note this [shouldn't  mean your app will be auto-magically faster](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10703)**.
- üëç Very accurate diffing algorithm. The library will infer the minimum number of operations (insertion, move, deletion) to update DOM elements.
- üëç Non opinionated virtual DOM library. The library comes with a minimal/low-level definition of the concept of Component. If you're looking to build your own abstraction on top of the library, this is your thing.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save petit-dom
```

or

```sh
$ yarn add petit-dom
```

## Usage


If you're using Babel you can use JSX syntax by putting a `/* @jsx h */` at the top of the source file.

```js
/* @jsx h */
import { h, mount, patch } from 'petit-dom'

// create a virtual node
let vnode = <h1>Hello world!</h1>

// `mount(vnode)` return a DOM node 
document.body.appendChild(mount(vnode))

// patch(newVNode, oldVNode) patches a previously created & mounted vnode
let vnode2 = <h1>Hello again</h1>
patch(vnode2, vnode)
```

petit-dom has also a first class support for render functions (aka functional components).

```js
/* @jsx h */
import { h, mount } from 'petit-dom'

function Box(props, content) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 onclick={props.onclick}>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{content}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

const vnode = (
  <div>
    <Box title="Fancy box">
      Put your content here
    </Box>
  </div>
)

document.body.appendChild(mount(vnode))
```

render functions behave like React pure components. Patching with the same
arguments will not cause any re-rendering. You can also attach a `shouldUpdate`
function to the render function to customize the re-rendering behavior (By default
props are tested for shallow equality and content is tested for reference equality,
the lib assumes the same set of keys is provided inside props).


### Custom components

In addition to render functions, you can also provide custom components that has full control on how to mount/update
the DOM under a certain tree.

More concretely a custom Component can be either an object of the shape

```js
{  
  mount(props, content) => DOMNode
  patch(DOMNode, newProps, oldProps, newContent, oldContent) => DOMNode
  unmount(DOMNode)
}
```

The 3 methods can beused to control the whole virtual DOM update lifecycle. `mount` will be called when the library needs to 
create a new Node under the actual DOM tree. The method must return a DOM node to be inserted at the component location. `patch` 
is invoked when the parent node needs to update the previously create Node. And finally `unmount` is called when the Node is 
removed from the DOM.

A custom component can also be a class which implements the above three methods. In this case, each time a new Node has to be
mounted, a new instance of the provided class is created and the `mount` method is invoked. For convenience, both the class
constructor and `mount` are provided `props` and `content`. Similarly, when the parent needs to update the previously
created node the node, the `patch` method is invoked on the previously created instance. And similarly `unmount` method of
the instance when the parent needs to remove the DOM node.

Below an example of a simple but working implementation of a generic Component class

```js
import {mount, patch, unmount} from "petit-dom"

class Component {
  constructor(props = {}, content) {
    const self = this
    this._tag = 'x-' + this.constructor.name.toLowerCase()
    this.props = props
    this.content = content
  }
  mount() {
    this._vnode = h(this._tag, null, this.render())
    const node = mount(this._vnode)
    node.$$instance = this // make instance accessible in devtools
    return node
  }
  patch(node, props, oldProps, content, oldContent) {
    this.props = props
    this.content = content
    this.updateUI()
    return node
  }
  unmount(node) {
    node.$$instance = null
    return unmount(this._vnode)
  }
  updateUI() {
    const oldVnode = this._vnode
    this._vnode = h(this._tag, null, this.render())
    patch(this._vnode, oldVnode)
  }
}
```

And an example application of how to use the Component super class

```js
import { h } from 'petit-dom'

class Counter extends Component {
  
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.count = 0
  }
  
  increment() {
    this.count++
    this.updateUI()
  }
  
  /* Hooks on callback methods */
  mount() {
    console.log('mounting Counter')
    return super.mount()
  }
  
  patch(...args) {
    console.log('patching Counter')
    return super.patch(...args)
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      h('div', { className: 'box' },
        h('h2', null, 'Child Component'),
        h('span', 
          { style: 'color: red' }, 
          `${this.props.label}...`
        ),
        `${this.count}...`,            
        h('button', { onclick: () => this.increment() }, 'Increment')
      )
    )
  }
}

class App extends Component {

  constructor() {
    super()
    this.label = 'Current count'
  }

  render() {
    return h('div', null,
      h('h1', null, 'Parent component'),
      h('input', { 
        style: 'color: red',
        value: this.label,
        oninput: (e) => {
          this.label = e.target.value
          this.updateUI()
        }
      }),
      h('hr'),
      h(Counter, { label: this.label })
    )
  }
}

document.body.appendChild(mount(h(App)));
```
