# A note about the status of this library

Between school, work, and life, I don't have the time right now to maintain this library. If you're working on something that needs steam login support for the time being, I suggest you take a look at [passport-steam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-steam). It's a little more complex (I wrote this library as a simpler alternative to passport-steam), but it has a more mature codebase and active maintainers. If anyone wants to take over this project, either temporarily or permanently, see [issue #20 - project needs maintainer](https://github.com/cpancake/steam-login/issues/20).

# steam-login

Steam-only OpenID authentication provider, for simplicity. Think of it as a mini-[Passport](http://passportjs.org/), but only for Steam.

## Installation
You can install this library via npm:
```
npm install steam-login
```
You will need some sort of session library, like [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session).

## Example Usage

```js
var express = require('express'),
    steam   = require('steam-login');

var app = express();

app.use(require('express-session')({ resave: false, saveUninitialized: false, secret: 'a secret' }));
app.use(steam.middleware({
	realm: 'http://localhost:3000/', 
	verify: 'http://localhost:3000/verify',
	apiKey: process.argv[2]}
));

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
	res.send(req.user == null ? 'not logged in' : 'hello ' + req.user.username).end();
});

app.get('/authenticate', steam.authenticate(), function(req, res) {
	res.redirect('/');
});

app.get('/verify', steam.verify(), function(req, res) {
	res.send(req.user).end();
});

app.get('/logout', steam.enforceLogin('/'), function(req, res) {
	req.logout();
	res.redirect('/');
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log('listening');
```
