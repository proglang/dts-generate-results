ClientJS is a JavaScript library that makes digital fingerprinting easy, while also exposing all the browser data-points used in generating fingerprints.

If you want to fingerprint browsers, you are **_probably_** also interested in other client-based information, such as screen resolution, operating system, browser type, device type, and much more.

Below are some features that make ClientJS different from other fingerprinting libraries:
- It's pure native JavaScript
- It's decently lightweight at ~45 KB
- All user data points are available by design, not just the 32bit integer fingerprint

## Documentation and Demos
You can find more documentation and demos on each method at [clientjs.org](https://clientjs.org/).

## Installation
To use ClientJS, simply include `dist/client.min.js`.

ClientJS is available for download via [bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=clientjs) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clientjs).

### npm

```shell
npm install clientjs
```

### Bower

```shell
bower install clientjs
```

## Fingerprinting
Digital fingerprints are based on device/browser settings.
They allow you to make an "educated guess" about the identify of a new or returning visitor.
By taking multiple data points, combining them, and representing them as a number, you can be surprisingly accurate at recognizing not only browsers and devices, but also individual users.

This is useful for identifying users or devices without cookies or sessions.
It is not a full proof technique, but it has been shown to be statistically significant at accurately identifying devices.

Simply create a new ClientJS object.
Then call the `getFingerprint()` method which will return the browser/device fingerprint as a 32bit integer hash ID.

Below is an example of how to generate and display a fingerprint:

```javascript
// Create a new ClientJS object
var client = new ClientJS();

// Get the client's fingerprint id
var fingerprint = client.getFingerprint();

// Print the 32bit hash id to the console
console.log(fingerprint);
```

The current data-points that used to generate fingerprint 32bit integer hash ID is listed below:
- user agent
- screen print
- color depth
- current resolution
- available resolution
- device XDPI
- device YDPI
- plugin list
- font list
- local storage
- session storage
- timezone
- language
- system language
- cookies
- canvas print
