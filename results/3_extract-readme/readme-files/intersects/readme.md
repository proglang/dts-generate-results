## intersects

Collection of 2d collision/intersection checkers, supporting points, circles, ellipses, lines, rectangles, and polygons (covex).

## Live Example
[https://davidfig.github.io/intersects/](https://davidfig.github.io/intersects/)

## Installation

```
npm i intersects
```
or
```
yarn add intersects
```

## Usage

```js
var intersects = require('intersects');

var intersected = intersects.boxBox(x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2);
```

or

```js
var circleBox = require('intersects/circle-box');

var intersected = circleBox(x, y, r, x1, y1, w1, h1);
```

## Alternative Usage
If you don't want to package the library using rollup, browserify, etc., you can also include the prepackaged library, which includes a global Intersects object:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/intersects/umd/intersects.min.js"></script>
<script>
    var intersected = Intersects.polygonPoint(points, x, y);
</script>
```
