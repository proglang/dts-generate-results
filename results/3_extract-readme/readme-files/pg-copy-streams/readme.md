## pg-copy-streams

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-pg-copy-streams.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-pg-copy-streams)

COPY FROM / COPY TO for node-postgres.  Stream from one database to another, and stuff.

## how? what? huh?

Did you know the _all powerful_ PostgreSQL supports streaming binary data directly into and out of a table?
This means you can take your favorite CSV or TSV or whatever format file and pipe it directly into an existing PostgreSQL table.
You can also take a table and pipe it directly to a file, another database, stdout, even to `/dev/null` if you're crazy!

What this module gives you is a [Readable](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) or [Writable](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable) stream directly into/out of a table in your database.
This mode of interfacing with your table is _very fast_ and _very brittle_.  You are responsible for properly encoding and ordering all your columns. If anything is out of place PostgreSQL will send you back an error.  The stream works within a transaction so you wont leave things in a 1/2 borked state, but it's still good to be aware of.

If you're not familiar with the feature (I wasn't either) you can read this for some good helps: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-copy.html

## examples

### pipe from a table to stdout

```js
var {Pool} = require('pg');
var copyTo = require('pg-copy-streams').to;

var pool = new Pool();

pool.connect(function(err, client, done) {
  var stream = client.query(copyTo('COPY my_table TO STDOUT'));
  stream.pipe(process.stdout);
  stream.on('end', done);
  stream.on('error', done);
});
```

### pipe from a file to table

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var {Pool} = require('pg');
var copyFrom = require('pg-copy-streams').from;

var pool = new Pool();

pool.connect(function(err, client, done) {
  var stream = client.query(copyFrom('COPY my_table FROM STDIN'));
  var fileStream = fs.createReadStream('some_file.tsv')
  fileStream.on('error', done);
  stream.on('error', done);
  stream.on('end', done);
  fileStream.pipe(stream);
});
```

*Important*: Even if `pg-copy-streams.from` is used as a Writable (via `pipe`), you should not listen for the 'finish' event and expect that the COPY command has already been correctly acknowledged by the database. Internally, a duplex stream is used to pipe the data into the database connection and the COPY command should be considered complete only when the 'end' event is triggered.


## install

```sh
$ npm install pg-copy-streams
```

## notice

This module __only__ works with the pure JavaScript bindings.  If you're using `require('pg').native` please make sure to use normal `require('pg')` or `require('pg.js')` when you're using copy streams.

Before you set out on this magical piping journey, you _really_ should read this: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-copy.html, and you might want to take a look at the [tests](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-copy-streams/tree/master/test) to get an idea of how things work.

Take note of the following warning in the PostgreSQL documentation:
> COPY stops operation at the first error. This should not lead to problems in the event of a COPY TO, but the target table will already have received earlier rows in a COPY FROM. These rows will not be visible or accessible, but they still occupy disk space. This might amount to a considerable amount of wasted disk space if the failure happened well into a large copy operation. You might wish to invoke VACUUM to recover the wasted space.

## benchmarks

The COPY command is commonly used to move huge sets of data. This can put some pressure on the node.js loop, the amount of CPU or the amount of memory used.
There is a bench/ directory in the repository where benchmark scripts are stored. If you have performance issues with `pg-copy-stream` do not hesitate to write a new benchmark that highlights your issue. Please avoid to commit huge files (PR won't be accepted) and find other ways to generate huge datasets.

If you have a local instance of postgres on your machine, you can start a benchmark for example with

```sh
$ cd bench
$ PGPORT=5432 PGDATABASE=postgres node copy-from.js
```

## tests

In order to launch the test suite, you need to have a local instance of postgres running on your machine.

```sh
$ PGPORT=5432 PGDATABASE=postgres make test
```

## contributing

Instead of adding a bunch more code to the already bloated [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) I am trying to make the internals extensible and work on adding edge-case features as 3rd party modules.
This is one of those.

Please, if you have any issues with this, open an issue.

Better yet, submit a pull request.  I _love_ pull requests.

Generally how I work is if you submit a few pull requests and you're interested I'll make you a contributor and give you full access to everything.

Since this isn't a module with tons of installs and dependent modules I hope we can work together on this to iterate faster here and make something really useful.

## changelog

### version 2.x - published YYYY-MM-DD

### version 2.2.0 - published YYYY-MM-DD

 * Small refactor in copy-from passing from 3 push to 2 push in every chunk transform loop
 * Add bench/ directory for benchmarks
 * Add benchmark to compare performance of pg-copy-stream wrt psql during copy-from
 * Add benchmark to measure memory usage of copy-from

### version 2.1.0 - published 2019-03-19

 * Change README to stop using the pg pool singleton (removed after pg 7.0)
 * Do not register copy-to.pushBufferIfNeeded on the instance itself (avoid dangling method on the object)
 * Fix copy-to test wrt intermittent unhandled promise bug
 * Add tests regarding client re-use

### version 2.0.0 - published 2019-03-14

This version's major change is a modification in the COPY TO implementation. In the previous version, when a chunk was received from the database, it was analyzed and every row contained within that chunk was pushed individually down the stream pipeline. Small rows could lead to a "one chunk" / "thousands of row pushed" performance issue in node. Thanks to @rafatower & CartoDB for the patch.
This is considered to be a major change since some people could be relying on the fact that each outgoing chunk is an individual row.

Other changes in this version
 * Use Strict
 * Travis deprecation of old node version (0.12, 0.4). Support LTS 6, 8, 10 and Current 11
 * Update dev dependencies (pg, lodash)
 * Stop using deprecated Buffer constructor
 * Add package-lock.json
