## Installation

    $ npm install tinder


## Introduction

  tinderjs is a simple node.js wrapper around the Tinder API. Below is a simple example which gets a list of nearby profiles and prints them out:

```js
var tinder = require('tinder');
var client = new tinder.TinderClient();

client.authorize(
  <fb user token>,
  <fb user id>,
  function() {
    client.getRecommendations(10, function(error, data){
      console.log(data.results);
  });
});
```

## Supported APIs

### .authorize(fb token, fb id, callback)

  Authorizes the `TinderClient`. You must call this before any other method.

* `fb token` is a facebook user access token. You would acquire this by having your user log in using your application
* `fb id` is the id of the facebook user
* `callback` is called when the request completes

### .isAuthorized()

  Returns bool if TinderClient is authorized or not.

### .getAuthToken()

  Returns xAuthToken from authenticated user. Will be good if you want to save/cache the info.
  
### .setAuthToken(token)

  Set auth token if you have it saved, no need to do fb login every time

### .getDefaults()

  Returns information from tinder about your client, where you can find your user data and also globals (e.g: `recs_size`)
  that allows you to interact where api timeouts and limits.

### .userId

  Once authorized, this property will be set the current account's Tinder user id.

client.authorize(
  <fb user token>,
  <fb user id>,
  function() {
